# FairyFishGUI

Minimalistic generic chess variant GUI using [pyffish](https://pypi.org/project/pyffish/) and [PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI), based on the [PySimpleGUI Chess Demo](https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/Chess). Supports all chess variants supported by [Fairy-Stockfish](https://github.com/ianfab/Fairy-Stockfish)/pyffish.

For well-known variants better use more polished GUIs like [LiGround](https://github.com/ml-research/liground). This project is meant as a fallback for variants where no other compatible GUI is available.

## Installation

Install dependencies (e.g., in a virtualenv) using pip

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Run

To start the GUI, run

    python3 fairyfishgui.py
